## Hi there 👋, I'm Muqadas Rasheed


*"Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of intelligent effort."* – John Ruskin

SQA Engineer with 2.5 years of experience in ERP, FinTech, E-commerce, and multiple service-based domains. I have worked with both **product-based and service/project-based companies** and am currently handling projects in both domains. My focus is on delivering reliable software, improving processes, and making business workflows smooth and error-free.

I work across **Sales, Purchase, HR, Inventory, Warehouses, Production Units, Recoveries, Commissions, and Finance Ledgers**, designing test scenarios, identifying issues early, and ensuring the quality of releases. Alongside **manual testing**, I use **Playwright with Python** to automate critical flows and improve testing efficiency.  

I enjoy understanding business processes, validating complex scenarios, and collaborating with teams to deliver software that meets expectations. My approach balances **attention to detail** with **practical problem-solving**, ensuring software works as intended while keeping development and testing efficient.
